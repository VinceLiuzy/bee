/**
 * Database operation: Suid (select,update,insert,delete),
 * it supports more parameters than Suid.
 * 
 * <br>
 * <br>The SQL UPDATE statement consists of two parts: set and where. SuidRich specifies one of them 
 * <br>and tries to use the default implementation method for the other. 
 * <br>Therefore, the update method is divided into two parts:
 * <br>update and updateBy.
 * <br>In the <B>update</B> method, the string updateFields parameter (if has) can indicate the fields to be updated,
 * <br> and other fields may be converted to the where part of the SQL UPDATE statement (by default)
 * <br>Filter null and empty strings, which can be explicitly set through IncludeType)
 * 
 * <br>in the <B>updateBy</B> method, string whereFields (if has) can indicate the field used for WHERE in SQL.
 * <br>When whereFields is specified, fields that are not in whereFields will default.
 * <br>Convert to the set part of SQL UPDATE statement (null and empty strings are filtered by default, 
 * <br>which can be explicitly set through IncludeType).
 * <br>If the value of an attribute of the same entity is used in the where part, it is meaningless to use it 
 * <br>in the update set part (because their values are the same at this time)
 * <br>However, it can be set by using the set(String fieldName, Number num) and other methods; 
 * <br>The method set,setMultiply,setAdd,setWithField of condition is processed before processing the where field, 
 * <br>so it is not affected by the specified where condition field
 * 
 * <br>About the parameter <B>IncludeType</B>:
 * <br>If IncludeType is not set in condition, null and empty strings are filtered by default (but the fields set in op, between and notBetween methods in condition are not affected by the value of includeType.)
 * <br>If the field of entity is not null or empty, it will be translate to field=value.Other can define with condition.
 * 
 * <br>The fields set by the Condition of the update and updateBy methods will be parsed, which is not limited by the 
 * <br>IncludeType, nor affected by the updateFields parameter and the whereFields parameter.
